### Logs

> Day 1 - 19 sep

- Read "the kubernetes book" by nigel poulton
- Setup 3 nodes, and added a deployment for nginx, its service with a nodeport, and accessed it with curl
- Realize that lxc doesn't support mac, and find alternatives for k8s hard mode.
- Started 4 digital ocean instances, one as host and the others as cluster nodes with one master
- Got stuck on the k8s the hard way repo since I got confused about setting up loadbalancers. Thought whether or not those were required for the controller only or for everyone. Will get it up tomorrow.
